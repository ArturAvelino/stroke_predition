A machine learning project with the random forest algorithm and aiming to perform a classifier to determine whether each person has suffered a stroke or not. I start doing an exploratory analysis and then create a model with the PyCaret library. PyCaret is a library that automates the preprocessing, creation and evaluation of models. The final score is 96.74%.
